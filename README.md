# Hey Vince!

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies

`$ npm i`

## Start server

`$ node server`

- I'm using port 3000 (no reason but a common port)

## Test client side routes

- home page

`http://localhost:3000/`

- Add page

`http://localhost:3000/add`

- Search page

`http://localhost:3000/search`

- All 3 routes work
- Test to verify
- Analyze my code to see why mine works and yours does not
- Slack and let me know when you figured it out

## Good luck! You got this!
